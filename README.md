# An R markdown analysis of the Affective Signaling Theory

This repository contains the analysis files for 6 different experiments where we inspected the effect of affective signals on control adaptation

1. control_flanker (A control flanker test without any affective signals)
2. control_primeprobe (A control prime-probe test without any affective signals)
3. affective_flanker_valence (A modified flanker test with affective word signals - different valence levels)
4. affective_flanker_arousal (A modified flanker test with affective word signals - different arousal levels)
5. affective_primeprobe_valence (A modified prime-probe test with affective word signals - different valence levels)
6. affective_primeprobe_arousal (A modified prime-probe test with affective word signals - different arousal levels)
